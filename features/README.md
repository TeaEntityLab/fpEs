# Feature Map — fpEs

One file per feature area. Each answers: what exists, how to drive it, what
usually lies. Sweep order for a broad regression pass:
`core.md` → `reactive.md` → `pattern.md`.

- [core.md](core.md) — Maybe/Optional, Fp function helpers
- [reactive.md](reactive.md) — MonadIO, Publisher
- [pattern.md](pattern.md) — SumType, pattern matching

## Maintenance

Each feature file carries `source_commit` + `last_verified_at` +
`verification_status`. After any change to the covered source files, re-run
the affected feature's Drive section and update the metadata. Do not rewrite
the map on a schedule — re-verify on relevant code change only (event-driven,
not calendar-driven).

A `verification_status` of `failed` means the product changed; classify the
failure per VERIFY.md §When a check fails before editing the map.
